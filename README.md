# cloud-performance-variability-prediction
Source code for paper 'Cloud Performance Variability Prediction'.

**CPD_collection** and **CPD_counts** are for the changepoint detection (robseg) on CCGrid20 paper dataset(https://zenodo.org/record/3686952/#.X2u5yy8RrVU) and code takes example from https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/emulab/cloudlab-ccgrid20.

**BD_collection** and **BD_counts** are for the changepoint detection (Breakout Detection)  on CCGrid20 paper dataset.

**BreakoutDetection** and **cpd** are two methods for changepoint detection.

**changepoint_compare** is comparison for two methods.

**feature_importance** shows the feature importance in prediction.

**prediction_CP** predicts timestamp of changepoint.
